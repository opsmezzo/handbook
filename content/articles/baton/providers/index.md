`baton` is designed to work with a number of Infrastructure-as-a-Service providers out of the box:

* Amazon EC2
* Rackspace Cloud Servers
* OpenStack
* Joyent
* [Windows Azure](/baton/providers/azure)
* Digital Ocean
* Telefonica Instant Servers

`baton` abstracts away all of the provider specific details so that you don't have to worry about them. With that in mind, this section explains how to get up and running with each provider.
