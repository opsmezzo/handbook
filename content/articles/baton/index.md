## Basic Usage

`baton` is a robust and fully-featured orchestration toolset with a simple convention for executing commands:

``` bash
  $ baton <resource> <command>
```

for example:

``` bash
  $ baton groups list
```

will list all `group` resources in your current cloud setup. It is designed to be self documenting via the `baton help` command. For example to learn what the `groups list` command does:

``` bash
  $ baton help groups list
  info:   Welcome to baton
  info:   It worked if it ends with baton ok
  info:   Executing command help groups list
  help:   Lists all groups managed by conservatory.
  help:
  help:   baton groups list
  help:   baton groups list <provider>
  baton ok
```
