"Bootstrapping" a server refers to:

1. Installing `quill`, dependent, and os specific systems.
2. Installing (but not applying configuration or starting services) all systems for a given role.   

Servers are created and/or bootstrapped in `baton` via `baton servers create*`. Each of these commands creates a server within a group for a single IaaS provider.

```
  --role         Role of the server created
  --batch-size   Number of servers to create concurrently
  --batch-length Total number of servers to create
